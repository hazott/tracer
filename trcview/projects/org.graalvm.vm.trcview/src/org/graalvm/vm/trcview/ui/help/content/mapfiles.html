		<h1>Map Files</h1>
		<p>TRCView can import two different types of map files: binutils map files and map files generated by IDA Pro.</p>

		<h2>Binutils Map Files</h2>
		<p>To quickly import symbols from an ELF file, you can load a binutils map file. Such a map file can be generated with the following command:</p>
		<pre><code>nm program.elf > program.map</code></pre>
		<p>Keep in mind that the program might have been relocated during execution. If the program was relocated, you will have to adjust the addresses in the map file.</p>

		<h2>Binutils Map File Format</h2>
		<p>Every line defines a symbol and consists of three fields separated by space. The first field is the address in hexadecimal notation, the second field is the symbol type and the third field is the symbol name. Only symbols with type <code>a</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>t</code>, and <code>T</code> are processed.</p>
		<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
		<pre><code>00011a18 T usage</code></pre>
		<p>This line defines a symbol at address 0x00011a18 (<code>T</code> means "text", so this is probably a subroutine) with the name <code>usage</code>.</p>
